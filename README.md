# TicTacToe
Tic Tac Toe Game

Tic Tac Toe is a known, exciting game. I believe that this game is proper as a case study for learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript, especially for beginners. I have taught and programmed this game as a classroom practice in the web design and development course at the Goegan branch of Islamic Azad University. 
Please let me know if I have to provide any other information and I will be more than happy to help you with.

Sincerely,
